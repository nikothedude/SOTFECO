1.1.0

New [ULTRA REDACTED] objective
    Spawns in systems where [ULTRA REDACTED] spawns
        Can also spawn in abyssal hyperspace if youve encountered [ULTRA REDACTED]
        Extremely low chance to spawn in normal systems
    Constructs a few [ULTRA REDACTED] ships
        At least one overseer is guaranteed
        Fabricators can be constructed, but it requires you to enable it in lunasettings

    As with other one-time objectives that spawn ships, allowing the enemy to capture it has a chance to add
    special items to the battle loot

Dustkeeper emplacements now spawn
    High chance in dustkeeper systems
    Low chance in systems with duskkeeper proxy patrols

    Will betray you if you meet duskkeeper betrayal conditions

    Basically just a souped up remnant module with cyberwarfare

Strange light now only spawns if you've encountered dweller
    Higher chance in abyssal hyperspace

Shield generator no longer renders the FF indicator of the shield drone, nor its engines

1.0.1
Fixes a crash with ASB targetting modules

ASB platforms now only take a minute to reload
ASB range increased substantially
ASB has a new AI
    Prioritizes big, slow ships
    Ships engaged in combat more likely to be shot
        If the ship is in trouble, FAR more likely to be shot
    Phase ships mostly ignored
    Ships without shields and no phase are targeted far more
    If a ship has an eliminate order, it will almost always be picked

Shield generator given more shield HP
