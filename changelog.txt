1.2.0

Fixed threat/dweller objectives not spawning in places they should, ugh
Shield generators are no longer penetrated by plasma cannons and such
Shield generators now use opacity instead of jitter to communicate shield HP
Intrusion nodes no longer randomly explode

Added a few new objectives
    Credit cache
        Very rare

        Long cap time, gives you credits
        Doesnt spawn if youre not poor

    Mineral-Rich Asteroid
        Rare, only spawns in asteroid fields/belts

        Long cap time
        When captured, spawns a bomb on the asteroid
        When it detonates, the aSteroid explodes into a billion pieces, each of which can be collected to gain ore/volatiles

    Warp Beacon
        Very rare
        Long cap time
        Warps newly deployed ships to it

    Derelict Fleet
        Very Rare
        Long cap time

        A group of heavily damaged ships, primarily freighters
        Hail you when you arrive, asking for help, or begging for mercy

        Can spawn in 3 modes
            Friendly
            Hostile
            Oh Fuck Oh Shit

            Friendly objectives are friendly to you, hostile to the enemy
            Vice versa for hostile
            Oh fuck oh shit is hostile to both sides, and is rare

        When captured, repairs the ships and increases CR to 30%. They tehn join the battle with 0 DP contribution

        If captured by a friendly side, begins an immediate retreat
            If retreat is successful, and the side has the player in it, the player will get a bunch of resources and rep
        If captured by a hostile side, the ships are repaired and added to a random fleet of the hostile side
            Yes. ADDED
            These ships do not retreat and can be used in combat

1.1.1

Dustkeeper emplacements, if spawned by proxy warfleet condition, now start deployed by your side

ASB platforms now correclty identify who they're shooting at

Shield generators have halved overloda times

1.1.0

New [ULTRA REDACTED] objectives
    Spawns in systems where [ULTRA REDACTED] spawns
        Can also spawn in abyssal hyperspace if youve encountered [ULTRA REDACTED]
        Extremely low chance to spawn in normal systems
    1. Constructs a few [ULTRA REDACTED] ships
        At least one overseer is guaranteed
        Fabricators can be constructed, but it requires you to enable it in lunasettings
        As with other one-time objectives that spawn ships, allowing the enemy to capture it has a chance to add
        special items to the battle loot

    2. Just a [ULTRA REDACTED] emplacement
        Has a modified energy lash that can buff non-[ULTRA REDACTED] ships
        Four variants
        Very strong for an emplacement, but has capture time and respawn time to match

Dustkeeper emplacements now spawn
    High chance in dustkeeper systems
    Low chance in systems with duskkeeper proxy patrols

    Will betray you if you meet duskkeeper betrayal conditions

    Basically just a souped up remnant module with cyberwarfare

Strange light now only spawns if you've encountered dweller
    Higher chance in abyssal hyperspace

Shield generator no longer renders the FF indicator of the shield drone, nor its engines

Added station augment integration
    ASB Coordinator
        Spawns a number of ASB uplinks behind the station, depending on the ground defenses of the market

ASB uplinks no longer target undamageable ships

1.0.1
Fixes a crash with ASB targetting modules

ASB platforms now only take a minute to reload
ASB range increased substantially
ASB has a new AI
    Prioritizes big, slow ships
    Ships engaged in combat more likely to be shot
        If the ship is in trouble, FAR more likely to be shot
    Phase ships mostly ignored
    Ships without shields and no phase are targeted far more
    If a ship has an eliminate order, it will almost always be picked

Shield generator given more shield HP

1.0.0
