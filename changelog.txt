1.2.0

Fixed threat/dweller objectives not spawning in places they should, ugh

Added a few new objectives
    Credit cache
        Very rare

        Long cap time, gives you credits
        Doesnt spawn if youre not poor

    Gravitic anchor
        Very rare
        Long cap time
        Warps newly deployed ships to it

1.1.1

Dustkeeper emplacements, if spawned by proxy warfleet condition, now start deployed by your side

ASB platforms now correclty identify who they're shooting at

Shield generators have halved overloda times

1.1.0

New [ULTRA REDACTED] objectives
    Spawns in systems where [ULTRA REDACTED] spawns
        Can also spawn in abyssal hyperspace if youve encountered [ULTRA REDACTED]
        Extremely low chance to spawn in normal systems
    1. Constructs a few [ULTRA REDACTED] ships
        At least one overseer is guaranteed
        Fabricators can be constructed, but it requires you to enable it in lunasettings
        As with other one-time objectives that spawn ships, allowing the enemy to capture it has a chance to add
        special items to the battle loot

    2. Just a [ULTRA REDACTED] emplacement
        Has a modified energy lash that can buff non-[ULTRA REDACTED] ships
        Four variants
        Very strong for an emplacement, but has capture time and respawn time to match

Dustkeeper emplacements now spawn
    High chance in dustkeeper systems
    Low chance in systems with duskkeeper proxy patrols

    Will betray you if you meet duskkeeper betrayal conditions

    Basically just a souped up remnant module with cyberwarfare

Strange light now only spawns if you've encountered dweller
    Higher chance in abyssal hyperspace

Shield generator no longer renders the FF indicator of the shield drone, nor its engines

Added station augment integration
    ASB Coordinator
        Spawns a number of ASB uplinks behind the station, depending on the ground defenses of the market

ASB uplinks no longer target undamageable ships

1.0.1
Fixes a crash with ASB targetting modules

ASB platforms now only take a minute to reload
ASB range increased substantially
ASB has a new AI
    Prioritizes big, slow ships
    Ships engaged in combat more likely to be shot
        If the ship is in trouble, FAR more likely to be shot
    Phase ships mostly ignored
    Ships without shields and no phase are targeted far more
    If a ship has an eliminate order, it will almost always be picked

Shield generator given more shield HP
