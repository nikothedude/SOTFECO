Fixes a crash with ASB targetting modules

ASB platforms now only take a minute to reload
ASB range increased substantially
ASB has a new AI
    Prioritizes big, slow ships
    Ships engaged in combat more likely to be shot
        If the ship is in trouble, FAR more likely to be shot
    Phase ships mostly ignored
    Ships without shields and no phase are targeted far more
    If a ship has an eliminate order, it will almost always be picked

Shield generator given more shield HP
